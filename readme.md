## The Book List

Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

Copy this data into your JavaScript file:

```js
var books = [
  {
    title: "The Design of Everyday Things",
    author: "Don Norman",
    alreadyRead: false
  },
  {
    title: "The Most Human Human",
    author: "Brian Christian",
    alreadyRead: true
  },
  {
    title: "In Search of Lost Time",
    author: "Marcel Proust",
    alreadyRead: true
  },
  {
    title: "Ulysses",
    author: "James Joyce",
    alreadyRead: true
  },
  {
    title: "The Great Gatsby",
    author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    alreadyRead: true
  }
];
```

- In your JavaScript file:
  - Create an `h1` with the text of "My Book List", and put it inside `div.favoriteBooks`
  - Iterate through the array of books. For each book, create a `p` tag with the book title and author (e.g. "The Most Human Human, by Brian Christian"). Append it to the page

### Bonus

- Remove the list bullet points from your lists
- Add the book cover image. For each book, add an `img` element for each book on the page
- Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not (e.g. make the text color red if you have read it)
